# InterviewBike
JFrame with Map Characters with a Bike inside.


I used Java 11 to download the files and execute them. The code displays a 7x7 map with characters, and the bike is 
represented by the letter 'B'.

1. Download-->Build-->Build Project.
2. Run--> Edit Configurations-->Add New Configuration -->Application--> Rename "InterviewBike".
3. Build and Run "Java 11" and Principal Class Select "Main".


Actually, I was planning to choose the second problem because it seemed easier to me, but the first one caught
my interest. I put myself in the interviewer's shoes and thought that most people would choose the easy problem, 
so I decided to try to solve the first one, both to learn and to understand how it would be done.

The application uses JFrame because I thought that a bike on a map should be moderately visible.
