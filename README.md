# InterviewBike
JFrame with Map Characters with a Bike inside.


I used Java 11 to download the files and execute them. The code displays a 7x7 map with characters, and the bike is represented by the letter 'B'.

1. Download-->Build-->Build Project.
2. Run--> Edit Configurations-->Add New Configuration -->Application--> Rename "InterviewBike".
3. Build and Run "Java 11" and Principal Class Select "Main".
